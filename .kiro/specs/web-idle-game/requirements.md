# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete web-based idle game called IdleCity using HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The system will include automated deployment to GitHub Pages, allowing for a fully functional browser-based idle game with persistent progress storage. The game will be automatically deployed with every code push, creating a seamless development-to-production workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to create a basic HTML5 game structure, so that I have a foundation for building the idle game interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the game THEN the system SHALL generate an index.html file with game container and UI elements
2. WHEN the HTML loads THEN the system SHALL display game title, resource counters, and action buttons
3. WHEN structuring the HTML THEN the system SHALL use semantic elements for accessibility
4. IF the page loads THEN the system SHALL show a responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile
5. WHEN the game initializes THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to implement CSS styling for the idle game, so that the game has an attractive and functional user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling the game THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS classes for rapid development
2. WHEN displaying game elements THEN the system SHALL create visually distinct sections for resources, buildings, and actions
3. WHEN the user interacts with buttons THEN the system SHALL provide hover and click visual feedback
4. IF the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across all devices
5. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a cohesive color scheme and typography

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to implement core idle game mechanics in JavaScript, so that players can interact with the game and see progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize game state with starting resources and buildings
2. WHEN time passes THEN the system SHALL automatically increment resources based on buildings owned
3. WHEN players click action buttons THEN the system SHALL immediately update resource counters
4. IF players have sufficient resources THEN the system SHALL allow building purchases and upgrades
5. WHEN game state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect current values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be saved automatically, so that I don't lose my progress when I close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game state changes THEN the system SHALL automatically save progress to localStorage
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL restore previous game state from localStorage
3. WHEN saving data THEN the system SHALL store resources, buildings, and upgrade levels
4. IF localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and continue gameplay
5. WHEN data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL reset to default state and notify the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to implement a game loop with timers, so that the idle mechanics work continuously and smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a main game loop with consistent timing
2. WHEN the loop runs THEN the system SHALL update resources, check achievements, and refresh UI
3. WHEN calculating increments THEN the system SHALL use precise timing for fair resource generation
4. IF the browser tab becomes inactive THEN the system SHALL continue running or calculate offline progress
5. WHEN the game loop executes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance without lag

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to create a GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment, so that the game is automatically published to GitHub Pages on every code push.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger deployment workflow
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL create a deployable package of game assets
3. WHEN packaging completes THEN the system SHALL deploy the game to GitHub Pages
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain previous version
5. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL make the game accessible at https://username.github.io/repository-name

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to implement version control and project structure, so that the codebase is organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create appropriate directory structure for web assets
2. WHEN initializing Git THEN the system SHALL configure proper .gitignore for web development
3. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into logical modules
4. IF new features are added THEN the system SHALL maintain clean code organization and documentation
5. WHEN the repository is created THEN the system SHALL include README with setup and development instructions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to implement build and packaging automation, so that game assets are optimized and ready for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for deployment THEN the system SHALL create a zip package of all game assets
2. WHEN packaging assets THEN the system SHALL include all necessary HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files
3. WHEN optimizing for web THEN the system SHALL ensure files are properly structured for GitHub Pages
4. IF assets are missing THEN the system SHALL report errors and prevent incomplete deployment
5. WHEN packaging completes THEN the system SHALL verify all required files are included and accessible
