### 3. Deployment Status Script (`scripts/deployment-status.sh`)

Comprehensive deployment management tool.

#### Usage:
```bash
./scripts/deployment-status.sh [command] [options]

Commands:
  status          Show current deployment status
  monitor <url>   Monitor deployment health
  optimize        Optimize assets for deployment
  deploy          Trigger manual deployment
  logs            Show deployment logs
  clean           Clean deployment artifacts
```

#### Features:
- Deployment status tracking
- File verification
- GitHub Actions integration
- Log management
- Artifact cleanup

## üìä Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment (Push to main)
1. **Trigger**: Push to main branch
2. **Verification**: Enhanced asset verification with syntax checking
3. **Optimization**: Asset minification and compression
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to GitHub Pages with retry logic
5. **Health Check**: Comprehensive site validation
6. **Monitoring**: Performance metrics collection
7. **Reporting**: Detailed deployment summary

### Manual Deployment
1. **GitHub UI**: Go to Actions ‚Üí Deploy to GitHub Pages ‚Üí Run workflow
2. **GitHub CLI**: `gh workflow run deploy.yml`
3. **Status Script**: `./scripts/deployment-status.sh deploy`

## üîç Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Health Check Process
1. **HTTP Status**: Verify 200 OK response
2. **Content Validation**: Check for game title and scripts
3. **Performance**: Measure response time and size
4. **Retry Logic**: Up to 10 attempts with configurable delays

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Deployment Fails**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify all required files exist
- Run local asset verification: `./scripts/deployment-status.sh status`

#### **Health Check Fails**
- Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 10 minutes)
- Check if site is accessible manually
- Use force deploy option if content is correct

#### **Performance Issues**
- Review optimization report for large files
- Check network conditions
- Monitor over time: `node scripts/deploy-monitor.js <url> --monitor 300000`

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check deployment status
./scripts/deployment-status.sh status

# Monitor deployment health
./scripts/deployment-status.sh monitor https://your-site.github.io

# View deployment logs
./scripts/deployment-status.sh logs

# Optimize assets locally
./scripts/deployment-status.sh optimize

# Clean deployment artifacts
./scripts/deployment-status.sh clean
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Asset Optimization Results
Typical optimization savings:
- **JavaScript**: 30-50% size reduction
- **CSS**: 20-40% size reduction  
- **HTML**: 10-20% size reduction
- **Total**: 25-45% overall size reduction

### Performance Targets
- **Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 2 seconds
- **Time to Interactive**: < 4 seconds

## üîê Security Considerations

### Deployment Security
- GitHub Actions secrets for sensitive data
- Repository access controls
- Automated security scanning
- Content Security Policy headers

### Asset Security
- Input validation for all optimizations
- Safe HTML minification options
- Script integrity verification
- XSS prevention in dynamic content

## üöÄ Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
env:
  DEPLOYMENT_TIMEOUT: 300      # Deployment timeout in seconds
  HEALTH_CHECK_RETRIES: 10     # Number of health check attempts
  HEALTH_CHECK_DELAY: 15       # Delay between health checks
```

### Custom Optimization
```javascript
// Custom optimization options
const optimizer = new AssetOptimizer({
  inputDir: './src',
  outputDir: './dist',
  minifyJS: true,
  minifyCSS: true,
  minifyHTML: false,  // Disable HTML minification
  verbose: true
});
```

### Monitoring Configuration
```javascript
// Custom monitoring setup
const monitor = new DeploymentMonitor(url, {
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 10,
  interval: 15000,
  verbose: true
});
```
